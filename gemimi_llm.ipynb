      "**2. Hero Section:**\n",
      "* This section features a large, dark blue background with a stylized, glowing teal DNA double helix graphic.\n",
      "* Overlaid on the image is the congratulatory headline \"Congrats, you are ready to go!\" in a bold, white sans-serif font.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Introductory Text:**\n",
      "* Below the hero section is a block of explanatory text.  \n",

      "* The second paragraph mentions that the content is served from Google Drive (highlighted in blue and likely a hyperlink).\n",
      "* The third paragraph instructs the user to adjust a configuration file (`fstab.yaml`) and provides a link (in blue) to a tutorial.\n",
      "* Another headline, \"This is another headline here for more content,\" separates this section from the next visual element.\n",

      "**4. Second DNA Graphic:**\n",

      "**5. Columns Block and Buttons:**\n",

      "    * One\n",
      "    * Two\n",
      "    * Three\n",

      "    * Below that, another rounded rectangle button labeled \"Preview\" in black text on a light gray background.\n",
      "    * The text \"Or you can just view the preview\" sits above the \"Preview\" button.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Boilerplate Highlights Section:**\n",
      "* This section starts with the heading \"Boilerplate Highlights?\" followed by the subheading \"Find some of our favorite staff picks below:\".\n",
      "* Below this are four cards arranged in a two-by-two grid. Each card contains:\n",
      "    * An image (e.g., a blurred motion shot, an iceberg, a person walking towards light, a group of people collaborating).\n",
      "    * A bold heading (e.g., \"Unmatched speed,\" \"Content at scale,\" \"Uncertainty eliminated,\" \"Widen the talent pool\").\n",
      "    * A paragraph of descriptive text explaining the highlighted feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7.  Additional Feature Cards:**\n",
      "* Two more card pairs follow in the same two-by-two grid layout, with similar structure to the previous cards: image, bold heading, and descriptive paragraph.  Headings include \"The low-code way to developer productivity\", \"Headless is here\", and \"Peak performance\". Some cards have images, while others appear to be placeholders without images.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Footer:**\n",
      "* At the very bottom is a standard footer containing copyright information (© 2025 Adobe), and links to Privacy, Terms of Use, Cookie preferences, \"Do not sell my personal information,\" and AdChoices. These links are small, light gray, and separated by forward slashes.\n",
